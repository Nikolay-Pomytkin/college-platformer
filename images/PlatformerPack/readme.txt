Hello! My name is Fisher Goodwin and I am an independant developer 
who realized that people are still downloading this asset pack. 
Looking back on it I find it kinda lame, so I decided to add 
some stuff.

Quick note if you have problems or suggestionswith this asset 
pack I would be glad to answer / resolve any of your problems, 
contact me (see below). Apologies if it takes me too long to respond. 

I really dont know how to format this asset pack to people, as in 
if I should have all the sprites in one sheet, which is handy for 
the Gamemaker: Studio's engine, but im not sure if its easy to use
for any other engine... If you guys have any suggestion against my 
current sheet format, again, contact me.

Enjoy!
